CONFIGURE NGINX AS A LOAD BALANCER

I create an EC2 VM based on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS and name it Nginx LB (do not forget to open TCP port 80 for HTTP connections, also open TCP port 443 â€“ this port is used for secured HTTPS connections)

I update the instance and Install Nginx. i checked the status and it is running perfectly.
